## Prompt-processing database (PPDB)

Scripts to hatsify data from PPDB. This initial work follows a similar approach to that of [DASH](../dash/).

There is currently a collection available on USDF at: `/sdf/data/rubin/shared/lsdb_commissioning/hats/PPDB_v1/dia_object_collection`.

**Next steps (WIP):** Add data in increments.
