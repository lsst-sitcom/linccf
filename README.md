# LINCC Frameworks Rubin commissioning 

Notebooks and scripts written by or used by LINCC Frameworks during 
commissiong on Rubin ComCam data.

This is predominantly in service of providing HATS catalogs for Rubin data,
and showcasing science workflows using LSDB on those catalogs.

## Navigation Aids

* [`dash/`](./dash/) - **(DASH == DRP Afterburner for Super HATS)** - Source code and explanations for transforming Rubin Butler tables into HATS catalogs.
* [`dash_doc/`](./dash_doc/) - further explanation of DASH procedure.
* [`demo_notebooks/`](./demo_notebooks/) - Science notebooks show-casing LSDB use on RSP with early data products.
* [`dp1_variability/`](./dp1_variability/) - Notebooks for exploration of dim variable sources in the DP1 dataset.
* [`RSP/`](./RSP/) - Notebooks for continuous integration testing of HATS data products to be served in RSP
